            <p>As a Tier 1 Technical Support agent I was responsible for Internet Help Desk troubleshooting and repair
              tickets. This included remote access to the user's computer. I was also responsible for selling premium
              technical support services. As a Tier 1 Internet Help Desk agent, I was a vital part of the dispatch and
              ticketing process. As a mentor I was responsible for making sure new hires were ready to work on their own
              in a high stress and fast paced environment.
